Find the palmerpenguins data set online and load it into your Jupyter notebook. In your notebook, give an overview of the data set and the variables it contains.

Suggest the types of variables that should be used to model the variables in the data set in Python, explaining your rationale.
^ The types should be integers 
Create a bar chart of an appropriate variable in the data set. Then create a histogram of an appropriate variable in the data set.
